> **Wanderlust:**
>(n.) a strong desire for or impulse to wander or travel and explore the world. 

I absolutely love traveling and exploring the local culture where ever I go. Having visited multiple states within India, there's a long list to go. My international exploration began with a trip to Bhutan in 2013, and I have traveled to 10 countries since. (I am well aware that's not much).

I hope to start a travel blog soon to share my experiences and help fellow travelers. Meanwhile, here are some crazy travel stories:
* Got trapped in Hong Kong when typhoon [Mangkhut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Mangkhut) hit the city. It was the strongest typhoon to affect Hong Kong since 1983.
* Started my Euro trip in 2019 when the worst heatwave hit Europe in over 100 years. Essentially, I went to tropical climates leaving pleasant Bangalore weather behind.
* Won 50x on my first attempt at a slot machine in the Casino at Maine Bay Sands. Unfortunately, I put in only 1 SGD.

And here are some travel highlights,
* Skydived in New York and Prague.
* Scuba at Havelock Island in Andaman and Nicobar group of Islands, India.
* Saw THE 'Mona Lisa' after a terribly long line that took me over 2 hours.
