> **Wanderlust:**
>(n.) a strong desire for or impulse to wander or travel and explore the world. 

I absloutely love travelling and exploring local culture where ever I go. Having visited multiple states within India there's a long list to go. My international exploration began with a trip to Bhutan in 2013, and I have travelled to 10 countries since. (I am well aware that's not much).

I hope to start a travel blog soon to share my experiences and help fellow travellers. Meanwhile, here are some crazy travel stories:
* Got trapped in Hong Kong when typhoon [Mangkhut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Mangkhut) hit the city. It was the strongest typhoon to affect Hong Kong since 1983.
* Started my Euro trip in 2019 when it was hit by the worst heat wave in over 100 years. Basically I to tropical climates leaving pleasant Bangalore weather.
* Won 50x on my first attempt at a slot machine in the Casino at Maine Bay Sands. Unfortunately, I put in only 1 SGD.
